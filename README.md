### Just so you know üí≠

#### This is NOT a beginner project, and definitely NOT for the faint of heart.

##### It is currently in active development, and being updated regularly.

With that being said, if you have any questions, feel free to ask in the Discussion tab.

- All of the models with **`remix`** in the name are parts that I modified to work with this printer. Credits to all of the original authors are listed below.

    - I've also added both styles of E3D Clamps to the extruder folder, to help facilitate those who want to use an 18mm Capacitive ABL sensor and for others that don't.

    - The **`minimalist extruder lever`** needs to be mirrored in the slicer before printing in order for it to work with this design.

### NOTE ‚ö†Ô∏è

- **PLEASE** make sure that your printer is calibrated before attempting to print these parts. A lot of these parts can be printed without supports but there some that require them. Another option if you don't have a printer available to you would be to order them from an online 3D printing service.

You **WILL** have to measure and cut the Carbon Fiber Rods down to size, **PLEASE** use the proper PPE, measure twice to be precise and **BE SAFE** while cutting the rods down to size. You don't want to breathe any of the dust produced while cutting as it extremely hazardous to your lungs.

### To-Do List üìù

I'm currently waiting on a few more parts to come in the mail, that will greatly assist me with the photo documentation of this build.

* [ ] Add photos
* [x] Add custom firmware
* [ ] Add list of parts needed
* [ ] Add list of OctoPrint plugins
* [ ] Create an Instruction Wiki
