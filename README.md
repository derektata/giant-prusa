### üß∞ currently a work in progress üõ†Ô∏è

A repo that converts an Anet A8 Plus into a GIANT Prusa MK3S with a few other slight modifications.

### Upgrades ‚è´

- BIGTREETECH SKR 1.4 Turbo w/ TMC 2209 Drivers
- Raspberry Pi 3 B+ w/ Octoprint
- Genuine E3D V6 Hotend
- Capacitive Auto Bed Leveling
- Silicone Bed Springs
- Igus Drylin Polymer Bearings
- Carbon Fiber Rods - 6mm ID x 8mm OD x 500mm 

### Just so you know üí≠

All of the models with "**remix**" in the name are parts that I modified to work with this printer.

- I've also added both styles of E3D Clamps to the extruder folder, to help facilitate those who want to use an 18mm Capacitive ABL sensor and for others that don't.

- The **`minimalist extruder lever`** needs to be mirrored in the slicer before printing in order for it to work with this design.

### NOTE ‚ö†Ô∏è

You **WILL** have to measure and cut the Carbon Fiber Rods down to size, **PLEASE** use the proper PPE, measure twice to be precise and **BE SAFE** while cutting the rods down to size. You don't want to breathe any of the dust produced while cutting as it extremely hazardous to your lungs.

### To-Do List

I'm currently waiting on a few more parts to come in the mail, that will greatly assist me with the photo documentation of this build.

* [ ] Add photos
* [ ] Add custom firmware

### Shout Outs üì£

I would like to give a huge thank you to all of these folks who's designs helped me frankenstein this whole thing together, without your help this would've been a lot more difficult.
