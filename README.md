### üß∞ currently a work in progress üõ†Ô∏è
A repo that converts an Anet A8 Plus into a GIANT Prusa MK3S with a few other slight modifications.

All of the models with "**remix**" in the name are parts that I modified to work with this printer.

#### Just so you know...

I've also added both styles of E3D Clamps to the extruder folder, to help facilitate those who want to use an 18mm Capacitive ABL sensor.


### Shout Outs üì£

I would like to give a huge thank you to all of these folks who's designs helped me frankenstein this whole thing together, without your help this would've been a lot more difficult.
